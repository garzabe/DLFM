Milestone: The following is the list of ML architectures I plan on training and optimizing:

ANN
Random Forest
XGBoost
RNN
LSTM
xLSTMRN

sequence_length_search with the "default" input columns and ustar=None(drop) found a longest sequence length of 211
"" with ustar='na' found the same longest sequence length
with all hours of data included (no daylight filtering) and ustar='na', the longest sequence length is 236
